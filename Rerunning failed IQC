morning time are all levels out, saves time to calibrate again before patient samples go on. 
If one QC level is oout could be random error. Just rerun that qc level again. 

When patient samples on : 
RR all 3 levels of QC
RR all 3 Ls QC if fail.
If only one level > 2sd on secod rerun patient results generally ok via westgard rules. 
ISEs have narrow SD ranges so max 1sd is ok for running ises K+ & Na+ . because there is a very small diagnostic difference for potassium at 160 mmol/mol or potazium 6 mM
