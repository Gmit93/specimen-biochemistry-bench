* If clot in gel tube in plasma, can alter Ca2+, Mg2+ Phosphate.

Cannot recentrifuge the gel tube in one hospital. 
Transfer plasma to false bottom tube and can then recentrifuge. Original tube has the gel barrier that turns liquid during centrifuge so can leave that part alone. Just take the plasma and respin it for a few minutes
max. 

Potassium in a sample not centrifuged for 24 hours by literature increases it by 1 mmol/L . Normal reference range is 5.5-6.0 mmol/mol approx. Hence, day old specimens are important to do a date check. 

Gel tubes for potassiums must be centrifuged within 8 hours duration. 

* Relabelling a specimen needs identifiers that are used in the LIS system in Seach unknown function. Full name and date of birth if relabelling a bad label. 
MPA preanalytics p671, p701 archiver, p601 centrifuge auutomation to feed samples post separation to a decision bay and then a loading bay. 

Glucose is measured in fluoride oxalate preservative. Stable Haemolysis index of 1000 mg/dl in literature. Sometimes requires additional centrifugation for smaller samples. If unsure if specimen was spun 
can reject the specimen with excess hemolysis. Although, waste of a specimen, just centrifuge it to clean and draw the fresh plasma sample matrix. Centrifugation cleans the sample matrix. 
Glucose needs centrifuge within 30 minutes to prevent glycolysis so storage in the cold can help.

Cobas 8000 deselect all QC slots to ensure nothing else gets QC'ed. Then individually select QC analytes required. Easier to see which QC racks are required and select all. 
That way the racks will be taken in for testing specifically QC requested analytes per QC package name. 
MAke sure to deselect before new QC. C701 modules combo'ed with e701 modules.
